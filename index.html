## marketing

<aside class="notes"><p>Marketing! It&#39;s is pretty cool. It connects people selling things to people wanting to buy them. This helps us earn money, which can be used to create more things to sell and invest even more in marketing. A circle of sorts.</p>

<p>One of the strategies is to link a product to other popular concept. It&#39;s a way to grab people&#39;s attention and make them desire the linked product.</p>

Which is why this quote resonated with me:

> Every term that refers to something useful will become meaningless. Precisely _because_ the original thing is useful, the term becomes valuable for marketing. This means that stretching the term to include things not quite under the original definition allows them to benefit from the perceived value of the original thing. And that establishes a precedent, allowing things even a little further away to get the label, and the scope creeps ever outward.

Agile

<img src="Binaries/agile_manifesto_original.jpg" alt="" style="object-fit: scale-down">

notes:

The first term that comes to mind when thinking about success to the point of losing its original meaning is "agile." What initially began as a highly influential manifesto in 2001, representing the thoughts of a few individuals on the better way to develop software, has, over time, been co-opted into a marketable product, rendering its original intent almost unrecognizable.

Over time, it became an entire industry producing various methodologies and frameworks that promised to have a recipe for better ways of developing software.

dogma

notes:
Agile, as the term is used today has very little semblance to what it originally was. What began as a set of guiding principles in the Agile Manifesto has, for some, transformed into a strict adherence to specific methodologies, rather than adaptability and continuous improvement. In lots of organizations, it is practiced without a true understanding of the underlying mindset, often resulting in a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn't account for the unique needs and contexts of different projects. In these cases, agility becomes a set of rules to follow rather than a philosophy that encourages teams to respond to change, collaborate effectively, and prioritize customer satisfaction.

Scrum

notes:
Scrum and the scrum certification stands out as one of the best examples of this. It was so long on the forefront of the agile movement that many people associate the work agile with Scrum.

But Scrum is about project management, it's not about software. Even in the seminal work on Scrum, [_Agile Software Development with Scrum_](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Software-Development-Scrum/dp/0130676349) it is noted that Scrum is an addition to agile (typically Extreme Programming), not a substitute to it.

notes:
Another notable example would be SAFe, a process pretending to be agile while trying very hard to adopt the process already exiting in most organisations. It focuses on predictable delivery, not learning, not course correction.

Once system becomes distributed we call this kind of tests end to ends, hoping paradigm that served us well for so many years will be applicable in this universe.

Well it does not. I am yet to see a e2e test platform that’s not broken most of the time. It doesn’t matter if it’s small or big company it doesn’t matter if it’s a marketplace or a bank. E2E does not play with distribution. Reason, expectation of transactional consistency in inherently inconsistent environment. I will mention this later.

Speaking about the industry "influencers" and prominent figures of the community...

notes:
People like Charity Majors who I deeply respect.

Yes, these people have seen things. They also have a lot of opinions about ways of building software. These opinions are sometimes very correct, sometimes result of an inflated ego, but most often somewhere in between.

Overwhelming majority of these people have good intentions, even if they are selling something. They care about the craft and they have seen and built things. But their words or books are not absolute. Even when correct they are subject to time and can become outdated.

Some of them forget to say a very important thing. Do your own investigations and apply things that work for you. Don't do things because someone somewhere told you it's cool. Even when it is.
